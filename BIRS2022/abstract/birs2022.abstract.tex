\maketitle 

A Hadamard matrix is a square $(-1,1)$-matrix whose rows are pairwise
orthogonal. Kharaghani and Suda (2012) termed such a matrix balancedly
splittable if upon forming a submatrix from a subset of its rows, the columns of
the new matrix form a set of vectors which are at most biangular. This idea is
extended to apply to orthogonal designs among other generalizations of
Hadamard matrices. Time permitting, we will explore connections to related
objects. This is a joint work with Hadi Kharaghani and Sho Suda.
