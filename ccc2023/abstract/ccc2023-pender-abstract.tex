A weighing matrix is a square $(-1,0,+1)$-matrix with pairwise orthogonal rows
such that each row has a constant number of non-zero entries. If upon taking the
absolute values of all the entries of a weighing matrix, one obtains an
incidence matrix for a symmetric balanced incomplete block design, we say that
the weighing matrix is balanced. In this talk, we construct a new infinite
family of balanced weighing matrices. 

This is joint work with Dr. Hadi Kharaghani (University of Lethbridge) and Dr.
Sho Suda (National Defense Academy of Japan).
