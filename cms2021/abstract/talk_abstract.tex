\begin{abstract}
Balanced generalized weighing matrices with classical parameters are applied in the construction of new optimal constant weight $q$-ary codes. It is shown that these codes can be assumed to be generated by a single codeword. \\

This is a joint work with Hadi Kharaghani, Sho Suda, and Vlad Zeitsev.
